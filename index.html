        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img id="image" src="http://oi66.tinypic.com/16hj3ue.jpg">

        <p>My name is Hennadiy Lehendzevych and I am a developer in Kent, Washington. I enjoy singing, playing guitar, learning, and coding. In my free time I research subjects that interest me, learn coding, listen to music, skateboard, and play songs.</p>

        <h1>My Background</h1>

        <p> I graduated with a  B.A. in Accounting from Washington State University. I have been working for almost two years as a stocker for S.P. Richards Company. </p>

        <h1>Why Programming?</h1>

        <p>My interest in programming sparked after I found out how much my close friends enjoyed doing programming and coding. I discovered a real passion for it when I decided to learn coding on my own from professionals on Youtube. That is how I ended up at Coder Camps. The course allows me to continue to pursue my passion without returning to school for another degree in two years' time and continue to learn something I really enjoy doing. </p>
